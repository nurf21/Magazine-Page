        NASA's Artemis program is a major step forward in the agency's plans to return humans to the lunar surface by 2024. The program aims to establish a sustainable presence on the lunar surface, with the ultimate goal of sending humans to Mars in the 2030s. But what does the future of space exploration hold beyond the Artemis program?
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the key areas of focus for NASA's future space exploration plans is the development of new technologies. The agency is currently working on a number of advanced propulsion systems, including nuclear propulsion and advanced ion engines. These new technologies will be crucial for future deep space missions, such as those to Mars and beyond.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another area of focus for NASA is the development of new spacecraft designs. The agency is currently working on a number of new spacecraft concepts, including the Orion spacecraft and the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket. These new spacecraft will be designed to be more efficient and sustainable than current spacecraft, with the ability to carry larger crews and more cargo.

        <hr><p class="quote">" The future of space exploration is not just about sending humans to the moon or Mars, it's about creating a sustainable presence in space that will allow us to explore and study the universe in ways we never thought possible. " - NASA Administrator, Jim Bridenstine</p><hr>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        In addition to the development of new technologies and spacecraft designs, NASA is also working on a number of other initiatives to support future space exploration. These include the development of new space suits, the creation of a lunar gateway, and the establishment of a sustainable presence on the lunar surface.
      </p>
      <p>
        The future of space exploration is exciting and full of possibilities. With the development of new technologies and spacecraft designs, NASA is poised to take the next step in human spaceflight. Whether it's returning humans to the lunar surface or sending them to Mars and beyond, the future of space exploration is sure to be an exciting and historic journey.
